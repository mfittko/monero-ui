# Product Requirements Document (PRD): CLI Wrapper and Autostart Feature

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the enhancement of the XMRig Web UI with a unified CLI interface using a proper CLI wrapper package and the addition of system autostart functionality. These improvements will provide better user experience, system integration, and enterprise-ready deployment options.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals
- Replace custom CLI scripts with a professional CLI wrapper package
- Implement system autostart functionality for seamless user experience
- Provide unified command interface for all application operations
- Enable enterprise deployment with automated startup

### Success Metrics
- Single CLI command for all operations
- Cross-platform autostart support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Reduced setup complexity for end users
- Professional CLI help and error handling

## 3. User Stories

### As a Developer
- I want a unified CLI interface so I can easily manage the application
- I want proper help documentation so I can understand all available commands
- I want consistent command structure so I can predict command patterns

### As a System Administrator
- I want autostart functionality so the service starts automatically on boot
- I want to configure autostart settings so I can customize startup behavior
- I want to disable autostart so I can control when the service runs

### As an End User
- I want the application to start automatically so I don't have to remember to start it
- I want simple commands so I can operate the application without technical knowledge
- I want clear feedback so I understand what the application is doing

## 4. Technical Requirements

### CLI Wrapper Requirements
- Use industry-standard CLI package (Commander.js recommended)
- Support subcommands with proper help documentation
- Implement interactive prompts for configuration
- Provide JSON/text output formats
- Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages

### Autostart Requirements
- Support systemd (Linux)
- Support launchd (macOS)
- Support Windows Services (Windows)
- Configurable startup delay
- Automatic restart on failure
- Logging integration

### Cross-Platform Requirements
- Auto-detect operating system
- Platform-specific installation paths
- Proper permission handling
- Service management integration

## 5. Feature Specifications

### CLI Commands Structure
```
xmrig-ui [command] [options]

Commands:
  start          Start the application
  stop           Stop the application
  status         Show application status
  restart        Restart the application
  daemon         Manage daemon mode
  autostart      Configure autostart settings
  install        Install application shortcuts
  uninstall      Remove application
  config         Manage configuration
  logs           View application logs
```

### Autostart Features
- Enable/disable autostart
- Configure startup delay
- Set custom port/host
- Configure logging level
- Set restart policy

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CLI Wrapper Integration
1. Install Commander.js as dependency
2. Create main CLI entry point
3. Migrate existing scripts to CLI commands
4. Add proper help documentation
5. Implement interactive configuration

### Phase 2: Autostart Implementation
1. Create autostart detection utilities
2. Implement systemd service generation (Linux)
3. Implement launchd plist generation (macOS)
4. Implement Windows service registration
5. Add autostart management commands

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
1. Update package.json scripts
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Create installation documentation
4. Test across all supported platforms
5. Add uninstall functionality

## 7. Dependencies

### Required Packages
- `commander`: CLI framework
- `inquirer`: Interactive prompts
- `chalk`: Colored terminal output
- `ora`: Loading spinners
- `boxen`: Terminal boxes for messages

### System Dependencies
- Node.js ≥20.19.4
- Platform-specific service managers
- Appropriate system permissions

## 8. Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- Permission issues during autostart installation
- Platform-specific service management differences
- Node.js version compatibility across systems

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive permission checking
- Fallback methods for service installation
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting steps

## 9. Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ All CLI commands work consistently
- ✅ Autostart functions on all supported platforms
- ✅ Service can be enabled/disabled via CLI
- ✅ Application logs are accessible via CLI
- ✅ Configuration can be managed via CLI

### Non-Functional Requirements
- ✅ CLI response time < 2 seconds
- ✅ Help documentation is comprehensive
- ✅ Error messages are actionable
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility maintained
